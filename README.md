# FreePS
FreePS is an android app that connects and accelerates the supply and demand of freebies within a community, with two main features: finding the freebies and posting them.

The app uses Google API to navigate users to nearby freebies, whether it be just around the curb, in an empty lot, or by a dumpster. The user can them access the detailed description and claim the freebie.

For posting freebies, the app allows users to anonymously post items that they want to get rid of at the their current location.

We believe that FreePS ultimately creates a better connected community and healthier market between those who want to get rid of their things, and those who are in need, or find thrill in searching for them.

## Built with
Android Studio (Java and XML), Google Maps API, Google FIrebase
